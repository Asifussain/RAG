    "chunk_text": "Now building the future of work. “It’s not what went into a building, it’s what’ll come out of it.” — Jonathan Ive Chief Design Ofcer, Apple Max Towers at dusk as seen from the plaza inside Delhi One 3 2 Corporate culture is evolving. The future of work is increasingly moving away from the traditional workspace. As organisations evolve rapidly, space efciency and space agility is compromised. The current infrastructure is unable to fulfl the need for shared, communal and collaborative spaces. The importance of amenities and the role they play in designing employee experiences is growing, as 24×7 connectivity results in shrinking employee leisure time. Static workspaces act as an anathema to inspiration and innovation. Learning is looked at as an of-site experience, rather than a continuous process infuenced and reinforced by company culture through shared experiences. Our intention with Max Towers is to blend thoughtful design and superior hospitality to create an environment, which integrates work and life, nurturing a more productive, healthier and happier community. Growth of digital enterprise Deliberate design of Emergence of network and employee experiences team-based organisations 4 Excerpted from Deloitte Review, July 2017 Excerpted from CBRE Global Occupier Survey, 2017 Max Towers is an attempt to provide you with – an agile workplace that responds to work expansion and contraction with ease. – collaborative spaces like co-working zones and a fexible multi-use dining area that allow you to retain your space efciency. – thoughtfully designed amenities and conveniences. – a Culture and Learning Manager who curates experiences for occupants to reinforce the values of innovation, collaboration and inspiration, enabling on-site continuous learning around the workforce needs of today and tomorrow. – designed experiences around sports, training, events and competition to promote wellbeing. – sensible nutrition and facilities that promote physical and mental wellness.",

To us, it stands for a lifestyle where all the physical amenities of a modern workspace come together with human-centric design. “Work” and “Life” have stopped being two distinct halves of our culture.
